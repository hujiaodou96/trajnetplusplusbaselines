Data Setup
==========

Data Directory Setup
--------------------

All Datasets are stored in DATA_BLOCK

All Models after training are stored in OUTPUT_BLOCK: ``mkdir OUTPUT_BLOCK``

Data Conversion
---------------

For data conversion, refer to trajnetplusplusdataset.

After conversion, copy the converted dataset to DATA_BLOCK

Training LSTMs
==============

The training script: python -m trajnetbaselines.lstm.trainer_update 

Three lstm models will be trained by running this script :

Model two: "use_goals_pred_goals", 
    train the pred_goals model with goals and use the pred_goals to train the pred_trajs model
Model one: "not_use_goals", 
    train the pred_trajs model without using goals but zero Tensor instead
Model zero: "use_goals_pred_trajs",  
    train the pred_trajs model with the true goal coordinates
    
The training loss of pred_trajs model of these three models is shown in the training_loss.pdf
